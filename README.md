# Movie Data Analysis using Pandas

## Overview

This project involves analyzing movie data using the Pandas library in Python. The dataset used for this analysis contains information about movies including their popularity, budget, revenue, profit, rate of interest, vote count, vote average, release year, genres, and release date.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Plotly Express
- NumPy

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from `movies.csv`. It includes the following columns:

- `popularity`: Popularity of the movie
- `budget`: Budget of the movie
- `revenue`: Revenue generated by the movie
- `profit`: Profit made by the movie (calculated as revenue - budget)
- `RateofInterest`: Rate of interest (calculated as profit / budget)
- `vote_count`: Number of votes
- `vote_average`: Average rating given by users
- `release_year`: Year of release
- `genres`: Genres of the movie
- `release_date`: Release date of the movie

## Steps

1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded using Pandas `read_csv` function.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Null value handling: Columns with significant null values are dropped or filled appropriately.
   - Data type conversion: Date columns are converted to datetime type.
   - Exploding genres: The `genres` column is split and exploded to analyze movies by genres.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Various visualizations are created to understand trends over different years, months, and genres.
4. **Insights**:
   - Popularity trends over different months and years.
   - Revenue analysis by month.
   - Genres popularity analysis.
   - Relationship between popularity and vote average.
